## üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Analysis 

#üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL.

The goal is to perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis to derive insights about:

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Customer behavior

üì¶ Product category performance

üìà Sales trends over time

## üóÇÔ∏è Table Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```
# üßπ Data Cleaning

Removed rows with NULL values in important fields.

Ensured correct row count before and after cleaning.

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE transactions_id IS NULL
   OR sale_date IS NULL
   OR sale_time IS NULL
   OR customer_id IS NULL
   OR gender IS NULL
   OR age IS NULL
   OR category IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL
   OR price_per_unit IS NULL
   OR cogs IS NULL
   OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

SELECT 
    * 
FROM retail_sales 
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Category-wise Sales Performance
```sql
SELECT 
    category, 
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales_by_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category;
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Average Age of Beauty Customers
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    ROUND(AVG(age),2) AS avg_age
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
HAVING category = 'Beauty';
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Customers by Sales
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM retail_sales

ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

7Ô∏è‚É£ Best Selling Month Each Year
```sql
SELECT 
    year, 
    month,
    avg_sales
FROM (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
        AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sales,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date)
                    ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM retail_sales
    GROUP BY 1,2
) AS t1
WHERE rank = 1;
```

8Ô∏è‚É£ Shift-wise Orders (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
```sql
WITH hourly_sale AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
            WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
            ELSE 'Evening'
        END AS shift
    FROM retail_sales

SELECT 
    shift, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
